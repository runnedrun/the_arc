The Arc is an AI-driven browser game where four players become the newly appointed leaders of tribes coexisting in a shared valley. Spanning 40 years of in-game time (represented by 40 rounds), each player secretly defines a vision for the valley’s future—be it populating it with mythical creatures or instilling a cultural love for a particular cuisine. The valley is depicted as a 4x4 grid, with each tile possessing its own evolving story written by AI historians. Players interact with these historians by sending messages composed of letters, the game’s primary resource, to influence the tile’s history in line with their objectives.

As time progresses and your character ages, your ability to act directly diminishes, shifting the focus to influencing NPC tribe members and leveraging the powerful Elder Council—a collective AI entity capable of enacting valley-wide changes. Strategic management of letters is crucial, as they are used to perform actions, and communicate with NPCs and the Council. The game culminates with an AI judge reviewing the valley’s entire history to determine which player’s vision most profoundly shaped the arc of the valley’s development. The Arc offers a unique blend of strategy, storytelling, and AI interaction, immersing players in a dynamic simulation of societal evolution.

Game Overview
• Players: 4
• Duration: 40 rounds (years), each round lasting 1.5 minutes
• Objective: Achieve your secret vision for the valley’s future by influencing its development through strategic actions and interactions.

Components
• Valley Grid: A 4x4 grid representing the valley.
• Letters: The game’s primary resource, used to perform actions.
• AI Historians: AI models that record and update the history of each tile.
• NPC Tribe Members: AI-controlled characters influenced by players.
• Elder Council: A powerful AI entity that can affect the entire valley.
• AI Judge: An AI that determines the winner based on the valley’s history.

Setup 1. Secret Objectives:
• Each player writes a secret vision for the valley’s future (max 200 characters).
• This vision is kept hidden from other players. 2. Starting Positions:
• Players choose a starting tile on the valley grid. 3. Initial Resources:
• Each player starts with a stockpile of letters (e.g., 500 letters).

Game Play
Game Structure
• The game is played over 40 rounds, representing 40 years.
• Each round consists of:
• Player Phase (1.5 minutes): Players perform actions simultaneously.
• AI Resolution Phase: AI entities process actions and update the game state.

Player Phase Actions
During each round, players can: 1. Move:
• Move to an adjacent tile (up, down, left, right). 2. Perform Actions on Tiles:
• Send Messages to AI Historians: Describe actions to influence the tile’s story.
• Messages consume letters from your stockpile.
• The maximum letters you can spend per round decreases as you age. 3. Interact with NPC Tribe Members:
• Communicate with NPCs on your tile to influence their behavior.
• Messages consume letters.
• Influenced NPCs may act in ways that support your objectives. 4. Influence the Elder Council:
• Send proposals or requests to influence the Council’s decisions.

AI Resolution Phase 1. Add Player Actions:
• AI Historians RECEIVE the player messages, but do not update the history yet. 2. NPC Actions:
• NPCs perform actions independently, influenced by prior interactions. 3. Elder Council Actions:
• Acts on tiles or NPCs based on player contributions and proposals.
• Can enforce policies, send messages to all NPCs, or punish non-compliance. 4. Tile History Updates:
• Based on all the messages received. The AI Historians summarize the year’s events for each tile, taking into account plausibility based on the existing history for the tile

Letters (Resource Management)
• Usage: Letters are required for all actions (messages, influencing NPCs).
• Acquisition: Gain letters each round automatically
• Limitations: The maximum letters you can spend per round decreases over time due to aging.

Aging
• Progression: Over 40 rounds, your character ages, reducing your influence.
• Letter Spending Cap:
• Starts at 300 letters.
• Decreases by 10 incrementally each round.
• Reaches zero in the last 10 rounds.

NPC Tribe Members
• Behavior: Autonomous but can be influenced by players.
• Capabilities:
• Move, send messages to AI Historians.
• Possess their own letter stockpiles.
• Generation: A new NPC appears on each player’s tile every 5 rounds.

Elder Council
• Role: A powerful AI that can influence any tile or NPC.
• Actions:
• Enforce policies across the valley.
• Send messages to all NPCs.
• Punish or reward players and NPCs based on compliance.
• Funding: Requires letters from players and NPCs to operate.

Winning the Game
• Objective Fulfillment: The AI Judge reviews the entire valley’s history.
• Evaluation: Determines which player best achieved their secret objective.
• Outcome: The player whose vision most aligns with the valley’s history wins.
